3. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if available)

- **Credit**: We acknowledge security researchers who report vulnerabilities responsibly

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Vulnerabilities and Mitigations

#### 1. Validator.js URL Validation Bypass (GHSA-9965-vmph-33xx)
- **Severity**: Moderate (CVSS 6.1)
- **Status**: Known issue in validator v13.15.15 (latest)
- **Affected Components**: express-validator, sequelize validation
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Additional URL validation layers implemented in security middleware
  - Input sanitization applied before validator usage
  - Content Security Policy (CSP) headers configured
  - Regular expression based URL validation as backup
- **Remediation Plan**: Monitoring for validator package updates

#### 2. Development Dependencies
Several development dependencies have known vulnerabilities:
- **artillery**: Uses vulnerable versions of axios and posthog-node
- **lint-staged**: Uses vulnerable micromatch (ReDoS)
- **nodemon**: Uses vulnerable semver (ReDoS)

**Mitigation**: These only affect development environment and are not exposed in production

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` files to version control
   - Use `.env.example` as a template
   - Rotate secrets regularly

2. **API Keys and Tokens**
   - Store securely in environment variables
   - Use different keys for development/production
   - Implement key rotation policies

3. **Private Keys (Blockchain)**
   - Never expose private keys in code or logs
   - Use hardware wallets for production
   - Enable encryption for stored keys

### For Contributors

1. **Code Security**
   - Run `npm audit` before committing
   - Use prepared statements for database queries
   - Validate and sanitize all user inputs
   - Avoid using `eval()` or dynamic code execution
   - Use security linters (eslint-plugin-security)

2. **Dependencies**
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Review security advisories
   - Use lockfiles (package-lock.json)

3. **Testing**
   - Include security tests
   - Test input validation
   - Test authentication/authorization
   - Run CodeQL security scanning

## Security Features

### Implemented Security Measures

1. **Web Security Headers**
   - Helmet.js for secure HTTP headers
   - Content Security Policy (CSP)
   - X-Frame-Options
   - X-Content-Type-Options
   - X-XSS-Protection

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - express-rate-limit configured
   - Protection against brute force attacks
   - API endpoint throttling

3. **Input Validation**
   - express-validator for request validation
   - Joi schemas for data validation
   - Custom validation middleware

4. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - JWT token-based authentication
   - bcrypt password hashing
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)

5. **Data Protection**
   - Encryption for sensitive data
   - Secure session management
   - CORS configuration

6. **Financial Security**
   - Test mode by default
   - Transaction confirmation requirements
   - Gas limit protections
   - Multi-signature support ready

## Security Monitoring

### Automated Security Checks

- **npm audit**: Run on every dependency update
- **CodeQL**: Automated security scanning on commits
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Security linting before commits

### Manual Security Reviews

- Quarterly security audits
- Code review requirements for security-sensitive changes
- Penetration testing recommendations

## Incident Response Plan

### In Case of Security Breach

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Preserve evidence/logs
   - Notify security team

2. **Assessment**
   - Determine scope of breach
   - Identify affected data/users
   - Assess potential impact

3. **Containment**
   - Apply patches/fixes
   - Rotate compromised credentials
   - Update security measures

4. **Communication**
   - Notify affected users
   - Publish security advisory
   - Document lessons learned

5. **Recovery**
   - Restore from secure backups
   - Verify system integrity
   - Monitor for residual issues
